					<p><strong>Ashlynn Ashford</strong> (born December 18th, 2004), also known as CRYPTIDFACTS is a Cryptozoologist and YouTuber located in Scotland. She is best known for her title as the 
					<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-6zpPIbYAA0cc0?format=jpg&name=medium" title="Ultimate Cryptozoologist">Ultimate Cryptozoologist,</a>
					and her ownership of the CRYPTIDFACTS YouTube channel.</p>
					<p>As of January 2026, she has reached 17+ million views, and about 67 thousand subscribers on her channel. She has been hosting a series of weekly videos called ‘The Hunt For The Cryptids’ reporting her current progress and adventures. She often brings guests onto this series.</p>
					<p>Her personal Tumblr account has been banned on several occasions after the corporation deemed her posts to violate their rules, specifically the 'Violent Content and Threats' and 'Spam' sections after a report campaign against her, yet her one for CRYPTIDFACTS has never received the same penalty.</p>

					<h2>Cryptozoology</h2>
					<p>Ashlynn Ashford got into Cryptozoology in 2021 because of a dispute between her and her twin brother Austyn Ashford <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-9nLH-XEAESxm5?format=jpg&name=small" title="ref1">[1].</a> Stated by herself on her Tumblr blog, she has made the claim that the only reason she originally got into it was the fun she could find in the topic, with her brother being insistent that no cryptids existed and her wanting to prove him wrong.</p>
					<p>Not too long after this, she was ‘hooked into the topic’, with her spending what money she had to travel and go on the hunt - dedicating almost all of her time to it. She has said that her brother used to come with her, yet she mostly travels alone nowadays.</p>
					<p>There are times that she brings others along with her, as recorded on her YouTube channel where she will collaborate with random guests of the week.</p>
					<p>Now, she states that Cryptozoology should be more important to all, as she believes that it is important to find out where we all came from, and to discover those that’s existence is disputed is important to discovering the root of humanity.</p>
					<p>She has said that her greatest achievement was finding the Cryptid known as “Bigfoot” in her video <a href="https://youtu.be/6fmRly1LL8w" title="Bigfoot Finding"> "WE FOUND BIGFOOT???????????? THFTC PT.92”</a>, though she didn't choose to stop her search after that. Her speech after it included a sendoff to another Cryptozoologist, saying "This one goes out to you, Mr. Beckjord!!!" Even with what she claims to be a real discovery, many still believe this to be a skit, or a fabrication.</p>
					<p>Her favorite Cryptids are The Loch Ness Monster and, more recently, Mothman - who she plans to find next.</>
					<p>Her current detour to Scotland during her THFTC series has had the series be on and off as of late, though she claims that it’ll be back to normal soon.</p>
					
					<h2>Loss</h2>
					<p>Ashlynn has talked throughout her later episodes in the THFTC series on how hard it is to cope with loss, and how she was so consistent with it in order to cope, though the furthest she’s ever gone with it was bringing up how she still hasn’t learned how to get over things. These topics are spread out throughout her videos, as she doesn’t like to talk on it for too long at a time, or too frequently.</p>
					<p>She confirmed on her Tumblr blog that it was about the loss of her twin brother Austyn Ashford during 2023, going on to tell her fans to stop digging about it as it made her uncomfortable to see it brought up over and over.</p>
					
					<h2>Controversy</h2>
					<p>Outside of those that criticize her work on Cryptozoology, many people have been off-put by Ashlynn for her threats towards Scottish entomologist Liisa July Belle during 2024. Including many posts on Tumblr stating that she was ‘in her house’ and that she was ‘gonna get her!’ while in Scotland, people seemed to be scared for Belle’s safety after both her and Ashlynn had already been arguing for months at that point on their Tumblr. This ended in a campaign by Belle’s followers to report Ashlynn’s account and to get it off of the platform, especially as her posts ramped up throughout this campaign.</p>
					<p>She has stated that the people who reported her are “stupid idiots who can’t think of subtext in sentences” and that she’s just going to come back anyway and that “they’re just mad i’m in her home”, causing more uproar in the community.</p>
					<p>Belle never made a comment on the situation with her fans, causing Ashlynn to continue saying it’s stupid that she can get away with her fans doing this harassment.</p>
					
					<h2>Ultimate Status</h2>
					<p>Ashlynn Ashford was granted the title of Ultimate Cryptozoologist on October 3rd 2023 for her work and passion towards the subject, all at her age (18 at the time). She has used this to further herself in both her YouTube content as well as using it to make people take her more seriously with her passion.</p>
					<p>It has been argued at some points if she should keep her title despite her harassment of fellow ultimate Liisa July Belle, though the entomologist herself said that she believes Ashlynn deserves to keep her title, “even if cryptozoology isn’t real”.</p>
